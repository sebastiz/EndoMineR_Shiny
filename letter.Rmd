Dear `r tolower(hi$forenames)` `r tolower(hi$Surname)`
\

I've now had a chance to look at the biopsies we took at endoscopy on `r params$data$Date`. These have shown no worrying cellular changes. I have therefore booked a further endoscopy which should take place around `r params$data$FU_Type`
\
\
I hope you find these results reassuring and I look forward to seeing you at the next endoscopy.
\
\
Yours sincerely
\
